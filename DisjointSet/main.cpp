Description: An implementation of Dijoint-Set / Union-Find data structure using path compression and some basic weighting heuristics.
Implementation: I used an array whose elements are the roots. Example: roots[i] = k means the ith element has a root k.
Weighting was handled by a second array which holds the "progeny" which is the number of things that point to that root (other than itself).
Other solutions using other data structures are also possible, but this is a very easy implement and has pretty good complexity for what it does.
Plenty of comments, many trivial, are added for clarity and teaching purposes. Email further questions to kevinj1121@gmail.com with COP3530 in subject line.
~~Things to note: if i is a root, then root[i] = i.
The file has certain input args. The first line is the number of elements. Each line after that has 3 args: operation element1 element2. If operation is 0 then we connect elements 1 and 2. If operation is 1, we determine if element 1 and 2 are connected. The file concludes when the input args are -1 -1 -1
Complexity: log(n)
